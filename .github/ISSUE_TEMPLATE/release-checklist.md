### Two Weeks Prior To Release

- [ ] **Release Champion named** whose responsibility is to ensure every item in this checklist gets completed
- [ ] **Compliance Release Lead named** whose responsibility is to ensure Temurin Compliance items marked with TC get completed
- [ ] **Release Checklist Created**  Create this issue to track the release and the preparation tasks.
- [ ] **Identify Expected Release Versions** - Find out the version numbers from [here](https://www.java.com/releases/)
- [ ] **Notify release branching of build repositories** : [Slack message, branching build repositories]
- [ ] **Create build repositories release Branches** : [Create build repository release branches]
- [ ] **Identify the aqa branch name for the upcoming release (Note, April and October PSU updates generally use same branch as the March/September new releases**
- [ ] **Check that the [temurin updater action] has not been suspended. If it has, re-enable it or set a reminder to run manually when ready.**

[Create build repository release branches]: https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/RELEASING.md#create-release-branch-on-below-repositories
[Slack message, branching build repositories]: https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/RELEASING.md#branching-message-for-build-related-repositories
[temurin updater action]: https://github.com/adoptium/marketplace-data/actions/workflows/temurin-updater.yml

### 1-1½ weeks prior to release

1½ weeks would typically mean running on the Friday so the dry-run(and potential "candidate" build) results are available on the Monday before release week.

CRL to ensure these TC steps are done (please complete steps in order, and ensure jobs have finished before proceeding to next step):
 - [ ] TC: Ensure ALL nodes are online. [Nodes list].
 - [ ] TC: Run [ProcessCheckMultiNode] to remove old test processes.
 - [ ] TC: Run [DeleteJCKMultiNode] to remove now-redundent jck versions.
 - [ ] TC: Run [DeleteNonJenkinsTestFiles] to remove any old test workspaces. Report any \"ERROR:\" to users for folder deletion.
 - [ ] TC: Run [Gather_Host_Info] to check all nodes have sufficient disk space and iNodes. If any nodes are found lacking, review and resolve.
 - [ ] TC: Run [Setup_JCK_Run_Multinode] to update jck_run folders and jtx exclude files.
 - [ ] TC: Run [DeleteWorkspaces] to clean up any lingering jenkins job materials.

 - [ ] **Check the nagios server to ensure there are no critical infrastructure issues**
  - Log in to the public [nagios](https://nagios.adoptopenjdk.net/nagios/) server, and check the Problems / Services page.
  - If you do not have access, please request it via an issue in the infrastructure repository. 
  - If there are any issues, then please log an issue in the infrastructure repository.
 - [ ] **Regenerate The Release Build Pipeline Jobs In Jenkins**
 - [ ] **Update testenv.properties in the AQA release branch to use the -dryrun-ga branches** ([Sample PR](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/pull/5202/files))
 - [ ] **Prepare & Perform Dry Run/Candidate Build & Tests** : [Dry-run](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/RELEASING.md#dry-run-tests-do-this-at-least-1-week-before-release-in-the-same-calendar-month) 
 - [ ] TC: **Triage dry-run/candidate TCK job results**
 - [ ] **Restore aqa-tests release branch testenv.properties JDK_BRANCH values to the "-ga" tag after dry-run/candidate has completed**
 - [ ] TC: (Optional based on perceived risk with any machine updates) **Perform TCK Auto-manuals on one platform**

### Thursday or Friday prior to release

- [ ] **Final Code Freeze Warning** post a message to the build & release slack channels : [Slack message](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/RELEASING.md#code-freeze-message)

After 1 day, then :-

- [ ] **Declare code freeze** to ensure stability of build systems and infrastructure during release process : #build and #release slack message: "Code Freeze is now being enabled"

- [ ] **Enable code freeze bot** : [Enabling code freeze](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/RELEASING.md#enable-code-freeze-on-the-build-repositories)

- [ ] **Prepare For Release**
  - [ ] Ensure that there is an [aqa-tests branch](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/branches) that matches the name of the [latest aqa-tests release version](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/releases/latest).
  - [ ] Update [releaseVersions](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines/blob/master/pipelines/build/regeneration/release_pipeline_generator.groovy#L10) with release versions.
  - [ ] Update [releasePlan.cfg](https://github.com/adoptium/mirror-scripts/blob/master/releasePlan.cfg) with expected tags, for more detail see [here](https://github.com/adoptium/mirror-scripts/tree/master#skara-repos-and-processes).
  - [ ] Generate release pipeline jobs with [release-pipeline-generator](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/build-scripts/job/utils/job/release-pipeline-generator).
    - DO NOT use default job parameter values. aqaReference should be the [latest aqa-tests release version](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/releases/latest).

**Wait For All Of The Above To Complete Successfully Before Proceeding!**

- [ ] TC: Log a helpdesk ticket with EF, to get all test materials updated and prepare for any manual activities
- [ ] TC: Run the ProcessCheckMultiNode process cleaning job on all ci.role.test nodes, to ensure healthy state, verify all nodes successful: https://ci.eclipse.org/temurin-compliance/job/ProcessCheckMultiNode/build?delay=0sec
- [ ] TC: Run the Setup_JCK_Run_Multinode job with CLEAN_DIR=true (to purge any old release contents/results) on all ci.role.test nodes, this will extract the jck_run folder with all the temurin.jtx exclude files, verify all nodes successful : https://ci.eclipse.org/temurin-compliance/job/Setup_JCK_Run_Multinode/build?delay=0sec
- [ ] Check the nagios server to ensure there are no critical infrastructure issues

#### Release Day Onwards

- [ ] **Check Tags have been released upstream** - Look for mailing list announcements and `-ga` tags in version control.
- [ ] **Check Tags have been Mirrored** [Mirrors](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/git-mirrors/job/git-mirrors/job/adoptium/).
- [ ] **Check "auto-trigger" pipelines or Launch build pipelines** for each version being released. Verify if the release pipeline "auto-triggered", if not (maybe expected tag was wrong), then manually launch [(as per release doc](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/RELEASING.md#steps-for-every-version)) once release tags are available via [launch page](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/build-scripts/job/openjdk8-pipeline/build) in Jenkins.  Provide links in this issue to each version's pipeline build(s). There may be multiple pipelines per version if primary and secondary platforms are separated to expedite the release.  In some cases,  where there are unforeseen configuration or infrastructure issues, reruns may be needed.
  - LTS jdk8 pipeline(s):
    - **primary jdk8 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
    - **secondary jdk8 pipeline (inc. Win32):**
      - reruns(s):
    - **aarch32-jdk8u pipeline:**
      - reruns(s):
  - LTS jdk11 pipeline(s):
    - **primary jdk11 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
    - **secondary jdk11 pipeline (inc. Win32):**
      - rerun(s):
  - LTS jdk17 pipeline(s):
    - **primary jdk17 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
    - **secondary jdk17 pipeline (inc. Win32):**
      - rerun(s):
  - LTS jdk21 pipeline(s):
    - **primary jdk21 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
    - **secondary jdk21 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
  - LTS jdk25 pipeline(s):
    - **primary jdk25 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
    - **secondary jdk25 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
  - STS jdkxx pipeline(s):
    - **primary jdkxx pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
    - **secondary jdkxx pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
- [ ] **Check Upstream Tags, Mirror Tags & Trigger Builds For JDK8 AARCH32** This specific version is built from a separate mirror repository and has a separate build process; this is CURRENTLY not part of the automation which is handled for the other platforms and version. Also note that there is a separate properties file (testenv_arm32.properties) which needs to be updated.
- [ ] **Add links to the [status doc](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin/issues/TEMPLATE_UPDATEME)** to indicate that the per-platform builds are ready.
- [ ] **Add website banner.**
  - [ ] Make a PR.

- [ ] TC: **Remind** TCK testers (via Slack comment) to update a TCK triage issue with ownership and machine IP **before** running any interactive/automanual tests.
- [ ] **Monitor and assist** the team during test triage (process outlined below)
  - **Summarise test results**.  Find each launched build pipeline in [TRSS](https://trss.adoptium.net/) to view a summary of test results.
  - **Use the Release Summary Report feature** in TRSS to generate a summary of failures, history and possible issues in markup format.
  - **Add the Test Summary** to a new aqa-tests issue, if one does not already exist.
  - **Triage** each build and test failure in the release summary report (following the [Triage guidelines](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/blob/master/doc/Triage.md)) and label them as blocking or non-blocking.
  - **Fix** blocking failures if they exist and confirm others are non-blocking.
